Cookie clicker type game made using Unity.


This game was made using C# in Unity engine and presented as my final project for the game development class I attended in college. The gameplay is short, as time efficiency and funcionality was the priority but the game was coded to have procedually generated enemies with the possibility to be endless(although not very fun because of the limited upgrades).


Fully implemented menu and interactive tutorial that explains the gameplay when you start.

The player can buy upgrades to help him defeat stronger enemies.

Reach the final stage and face the boss to reach other stages of the game(right now it just repeats but the enemies get stronger).
